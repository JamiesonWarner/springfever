Systems

For physics: Implement parent graphs for cells. This will enable movement.

For optimizing the flow patterns: Enforce a rectangle constraint on CellNetworks. I.e. if two cell networks are adjacent, then their thickness at the line of them  Then integration is easy, and graphics draw well due to symmetry.
